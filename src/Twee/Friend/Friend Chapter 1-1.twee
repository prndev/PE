You can’t wait to get over to $friend’s house again. You know $friendG.his_her parents will be at work and it will be great to hang out <<if $player.daring gte 3>>and get away from all the madness in your life currently<<endif>>. The house is as impressive from the sidewalk as you remember, but at least this time you know what to expect.

$friend opens the door and smiles widely at you before stepping back. You know the way now but let $friendG.him_her lead the way up the stairs. $friendG.His_Her bedroom is as big as you remember. There is a PSBox set up ready to play, a pile of board games on the shelves and a laptop at the desk, which is currently showing some anime screensaver. 

@@.friend;“Go crash on the couch,”@@ $friendG.he_she says grinning. @@.friend;“I’ll fix up some snacks and we can hang. Why don’t you pick something to do?"@@

@@.heroT;“Yeah sure,”@@ you say, ever the eloquent conversationalist.

You watch as $friend heads back downstairs, then flop back onto the couch. It’s incredibly comfortable, one of those LayzeeBoy ones with the speakers in the back and even a little fridge in the arm. 

@@.hero;I could get used to this!@@ you think to yourself as you kick your shoes off and make yourself comfortable.

Before you know it, $friend returns with a tray of snacks and sodas. You put down the manga you were just leafing through - the next one in your favorite series. You’re shocked $friend has it since it only came out today. 

@@.friend;“I’ve read it. You can borrow it if you like.”@@

@@.heroT;“You finished it already?”@@ you ask.

@@.friend;“Well, yeah, while I was waiting for you to come over.”@@

You would, but this is number 17. You haven’t been able to afford an issue since number 3.

$friend notices your hesitation. @@.friend;“I have the others if you need them. They were hard to get, I know.”@@

@@.heroT;“Awesome!”@@ you say excitedly. 

$friend opens a drawer in $friendG.his_her bookcase and you can see the huge pile of comics inside. $friendG.He_She sorts through them, puts them in a bag and hands them to you.

You hang out and chat about all sorts of manga and anime. Soon it’s time to go home and you pull your shoes back on, grab the bag and head out, giving $friend a <<if $flags.friendIsMale>>sholder bump<<else>>quick hug<<endif>>.
