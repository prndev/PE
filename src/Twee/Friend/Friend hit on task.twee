:: Friend hit on task [pos_5048_46]
\
You tell $friend that for homework in drama class, you have to record being hit on by a guy. He laughs. @@.friend;"No problem. I bet some people in your class will have trouble though. I bet some lonely nerd will have to find a random guy in the mall and end up getting their lights punched out."@@

You both go out to the street, prop your phone on a fence and hit record. You stand against a light pole doing your best to look alluring, while $friend walks into shot. He stops and looks at you, tilts his hips, and puts a finger to his lips in an exaggerated pose.

@@.friend;"Hey sexy"@@ he says to you in an over the top voice, @@.friend;"you doing anything later?"@@ You both lose it immediately and laugh hard. You ask him to try again, but less faggy. 

@@.friend;"Got it"@@ he says.

You both reset your positions, and this time he stops, grabs his crotch, and says @@.friend;"Ooh baby, get over here and suck my cock."@@ You both laugh again, then spend the next 20 minutes toning it down to something that finally seems believable.

You decide to head home to edit the video, so you say goodbye. \

	You think about it for a moment.
		
	@@.friend;"_rr.answer"@@ You grin at $friendG.his_her bad joke. \
