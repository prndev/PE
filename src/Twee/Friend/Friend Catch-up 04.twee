	$friend takes your hand and moves to the couch, pulling you down beside $friendG.him_her.

@@.friend;“So, why don’t you tell me what happened? And what’s with… with this?”@@ $friend asks, sweeping $friendG.his_her hand to indicate your new appearance.

At first you find it hard, but then, with $friend’s encouragement and soft touches... 

@@.hero;Wait, is $friendG.he_she hitting on me? No surely not…@@

...you slowly admit to what you have worn, and where. You leave out the pressure from $teacher from the embarrassment of what you have let her make you do. Only, it makes it sound like this is all your own idea. It’s probably better than admitting the truth. 

Before you know it, it’s getting late. $friend has been extremely helpful, encouraging and understanding, and somehow you feel better about this whole situation. As you step outside, you realize it’s started to rain a little, bringing you back to reality from the oasis of $friend’s house.
