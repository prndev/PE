	@@.teacher;“Needless to say, your performance today was perfect, but this was merely a lesson. There is still the real world beyond your schooling. Towards that end, I want you to cling to everything you have learned. You may not have a partner, yet, but you should focus on your future. Every action you take should be to make yourself a more perfect bride for your future spouse. As for today, well, your efforts were their own reward, congratulations.”@@

	Trembling slightly you nod as she steps away. She gestures in the direction of your clothes, and you dress yourself and depart. Your heart thunders in your chest, until you finally make your way out of the hotel lobby's doors.

	She dismisses you with a wave, and you shiver, realizing you will need to repeat the lesson next week..
