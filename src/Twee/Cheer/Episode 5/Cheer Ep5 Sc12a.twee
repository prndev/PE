:: Cheer Ep5 Sc12a
You sigh and start walking, looking down at the sheet you’ve been given. 

@@.hero;Might as well start memorizing it now.@@

<div style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><<RandomImageFromPack "Cheerleader note" 400 400>></div>\
The sheet of paper is divided in two columns. On the left are the lyrics of a song, one you remember causing some controversy as the video consisted almost entirely of the nubile young singer grinding on her male dancers’ crotches. Of course, Ashley would pick a song specifically about how much you want to fuck hot guys, with a video that roughly equates to porn.

The lyrics are broken into parts, and to the right of each part is a dance or cheerleading move, forming Ashley’s required routine. Also, Ashley has written in a cheer for you to perform during the instrumental bridge of the song:

You read the list, realizing your homework is cut out for you. Most of these moves sound less like cheerleading and more like dirty dancing. You guess that makes sense, seeing as Ashley seems determined to wring every last drop of embarrassment out of this “try-out” as she can.

Sighing, you keep walking to your destination.
