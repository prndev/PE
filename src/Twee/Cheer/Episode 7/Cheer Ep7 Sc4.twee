@@.cheerFriend;“Ashely totally lied to you.”@@ $cheerFriend.name replies. @@.cheerFriend;“$cheerleaders.fakeName was on her team as well, but Ashley didn’t tell you because she didn’t want to share the title.”@@

Rachel turns her attention to you. @@.cheerCaptain;“Is this true, $cheerleaders.fakeName?”@@ she asks.

You nod hesitantly.

@@.cheerCaptain;“What happened?”@@

You take a deep breath and tell her about experiences hunting for the school mascot, and while you intentionally gloss over the details of what exactly happened in the locker room, you give away enough to at least get your point across.

By the end of your story, $cheerFriend.name has covered her mouth in shock, and Rachel’s expression has fallen to one of steely displeasure. The cheer captain stands to her feet and orders, @@.cheerCaptain;“Ashley, Heather, Veronica, get over here!”@@

The entire practice field falls silent as Ashley and her two lackeys hesitantly approach. You can practically hear your own heartbeat through the tense silence.

Rachel’s voice lowers, but loses none of its furious intensity. @@.cheerCaptain;“I just finished speaking with $cheerleaders.fakeName about how you got your hands on the mascot.”@@

	Ashley nervously scoffs, then glares at you and $cheerFriend.name. @@.cheerBitch;“Fine. I was getting bored anyway.”@@

Rachel sighs and turns to you. @@.cheerCaptain;“Ashley pulls a lot of shit, but she knows when she’s gone too far. I don’t think she’ll give you any more problems, but if she does, let me know. I meant what I said about kicking her off the team.”@@
