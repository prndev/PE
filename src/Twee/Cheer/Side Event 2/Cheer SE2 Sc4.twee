	@@.heroT;“I love shooters. Play them all the time. I bet I could smoke your brother in Call of Honor.”@@

	She rolls her eyes. @@.cheerFriend;“Well, he is ten.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Oh. Right,”@@ you reply sheepishly, causing $cheerFriend.name to laugh.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Don’t worry. I’m sure I’d be impressed by your mad gaming skills,”@@ she playfully teases. @@.cheerFriend;“Maybe I should give you my brother’s username. I can only imagine his face when he gets beat by girl.”@@ She chuckles evilly. @@.cheerFriend;“He used to get so mad if I beat him in that dancing game.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Were you that good…”@@ you glance over at her with a sly grin, @@.heroT;“…or was he just that bad?”@@

	$cheerFriend.name smiles, confidently. @@.cheerFriend;“Maybe someday you should challenge me and find out.”@@

	@@.heroT;“I used to, but not as much anymore.”@@

	$cheerFriend.name looks surprised. @@.cheerFriend;“Why’d you stop?”@@

	@@.hero;If only she knew.@@

	@@.heroT;“Just kind of got distracted by a bunch of stuff.”@@

	$cheerFriend.name nods. @@.cheerFriend;“I understand. Life gets a lot busier when you get older. Maybe some time I’ll take you on in that dancing game, assuming we can kick my brother off the game console first.”@@

You polish off the rest of your cupcakes, and decide to do a little window shopping. After spending some time browsing shops for nothing in particular, $cheerFriend.name’s phone alarm begins to go off. She sighs. 

@@.cheerFriend;“That’s my cue. I told my parents I’d be home by dinner. Do you want me to drop you off at your house?”@@

@@.heroT;“Nah. I can walk home just as easily.”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Thanks. This was fun. Hopefully we can do it again some time.”@@

@@.heroT;“Looking forward to it,”@@ you reply.

$cheerFriend.name walks off, waving goodbye as she exits the doors of the mall. You smile as you wave back, pleased at how well the afternoon went.
