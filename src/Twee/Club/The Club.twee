	Once you begin to adjust to the bombardment of stimulation amid the semi-darkness of your immediate surroundings, you begin orientating to the club’s layout:

	Ahead is the dance floor, occupying most of the venue. To your right, a long and well-stocked bar, also bordered in lighted accents, wraps across most of an entire wall. On your left, a private escalator climbs to the VIP lounge on an overhanging mezzanine above, its entrance guarded by dark-suited security men. Behind you, a crowd of wallflowers and resting party-goers has clustered in the area next to the club’s entry doors, flanked in turn by the bathroom and a sound-proofed corridor that delivers guests to the club’s upscale restaurant.
	
	Trying not to attract attention you quickly make few selfies as a proof that you've been inside the club.

		As you enter the club's main room your <<if _heels>>heel<<else>>shoe<<endif>> kicks a scrunched up piece of paper. You glance down and see some calligraphic letters scrawled onto it. Curious, you bend down and pick the paper up, unfurling it with your<<if _nails>> manicured<<endif>> fingers. The writing is actually a single word…

		APPEASEMENT

	Thundering bass-driven beats and synths are accompanied by hundreds of strobes, spot beams and color fills, all in perpetual motion. They are given dimension and space by piped-in fog hanging above a throng of half-lit bodies dancing and moving to the rhythm. Above the crowd also rise a series of pedestals and platforms bathed in brilliant lights and encircled by serpentines of motion graphics displays, each afire with rapid-fire images and abstract patterns. Atop each of the high daises is one of the club’s staff dancers, with each girl clad in a form-fitting silver cat suit accented by glowing electro-luminescent strips.

	At the rear-center of the venue, a cockpit-like DJ booth on its own platform is lit by vibrantly colored floods and motion-patterned LEDs. The club’s female DJ is in perpetual motion, ably hyping up the crowd while keeping the stream of music flowing in a flawlessly smooth and entertaining mix session.
